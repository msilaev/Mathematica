# Mathematica
The notebook "GFcommented.nb" gives an example of the symbolic calculation of Green functions in the superconductor with Ising-type spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman field. 
It has been used in the calculation of the optical properties of recently discovered Ising superconductors https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03623. Symbolic expressions obtained in this notebook are converted to the Matlab format using ToMatalb.m function, which needs to be installed separately. 

The notebook "SkyrmionGitHub.nb" shows an example of nice 3D graphics in Mathematica used in various papers, for example in this press release
