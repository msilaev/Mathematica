# Mathematica
The notebook "GFcommented.nb" gives an example of the symbolic calculation of Green functions in the superconductor with Ising-type spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman field. 
It has been used in the calculation of the optical properties of recently discovered Ising superconductors https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03623. Symbolic expressions obtained in this notebook 
are used in the Matlab functions
